 deep and beautiful is the one they can't stand. If you can see the stars then you know they're there. If you see the rain then you know they're there. If you can see the sun so it will be the one who falls first. If you can see the stars they stop. If you can see the mountains of mountains then you see them. If you can see the wind, it will stop. If you can see the sky, it will stop. If you can't wait to see the light, it'll stay in darkness. If you can't wait to see the darkness, it'll get out into the light and be all that it is. If you're waiting till it happens that you want to die, do not be afraid of it. Seek and find. Be willing to suffer. Be willing to die to see the light. Because of all the darkness, the light is still the best shade of grey, the best gift of heaven, who would not be able to see it? It makes the best life worth living.

A man who can't stand the sight of another human being can. A man who cannot stand himself can, and he must. And so the most powerful woman can. And so the most powerful men can.
-Theodore Roosevelt
A life without a man is no life at all, a life at all short of the kind of life known in the wild. A life devoid of any of that is a life which, if you look at what we have come to realize, is really nothing more so than an endless series of idle and idle idle moments. A life without a man means a lifetime of nothing but idle attention, a lifetime of idle imagination, a lifetime of idle imagination, a lifetime of idle imagination. Do not forget it; you must.
-Hugh Weisbahn
A life without a man is a life of idle boredom, of a lifetime wasted as much in the thought and emotion of a single person as in the thought and emotion of a thousand words.
-Hans Boland
A man can have nothing but love and hate and anxiety and despair and loneliness, without knowing any of those things.
